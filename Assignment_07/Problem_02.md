Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList :

1. ArrayList uses Dynamic array to store the data, whereas LinkedList uses doubly LinkedList to store the data.
2. Manipulation of data in an ArrayList is expensive, whereas LinkedList takes lesser time to manipulate data.
3. ArrayList implements List inteface, whereas LinkedList implements both List and Dequeue intefaces.
4. ArrayList is used when  the elements are created and to be accessed to perform Read-Only operations, But LinkedList is used to manipulate the data multiple times.
5. Random Access is efficient in ArrayList, whereas the same is not efficient in LinkedList.
